What in the holy name of Kimi Raikkonen (autocorrect suggested "Raikko English") are Tifosi Dafusi doing with their strategy....
They went from sbinallaing Giovinazzi's raweceeks to now lmaoing Sharl Ledevil's races. 
And meanwhile the smooth operator sets new levels of consistency in both barely getting podiums and absolute zero coverage. Sky sports are more interested in Hamilton's 14th lockup of the year and George's complaints that a rival is not handing the position to him on a platter, cooked medium rare. 
Anyway, good luck, all this and more next (indefinite period of time) on The Tifosi Zone.
